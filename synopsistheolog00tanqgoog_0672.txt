specierum creatio, ut ab ipsis transformistis agnoscitur ε “The teleo-
logical and the mechanical views ol Nature are not necessarily nru-
tually exclusive3 on the contrary, the more purely a mechanist the
speculator ie, the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular
arrangement, of which all the phenomena of 'the universe are the
consequences; and the more completely thereby is he at the mercy of
the teleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this primor-
dial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena
ol the universe '’. lta Huxley, The Academy‚ ottob. 1869, apud Me-
vurt, Gen. of specieS, p. 291.

N· 47·51· Qteeedam argentearia evolutionr'starum allegam, quo
melius intelligantur: “The individual higher animal in embryonic
development passes through temporary stageS, which are similar in
many respedts to permanent or mature conditions in some of the lower
forms in the same group... Surely this sadi, if it be a fact, is wholly
inexplicable, except by the theory os derivation or evolution. The
embryo of a higher animal of any group passes now through stages
represented by lower forme, because in its evolution its ancestors did
adlrrally have these forms ''. (Le Corte, Evolution‚ Appleton‚ 1891,
c. Vll, p. 148-149). ldem audior tanquam exempla inutilium organo·

are never cut, the rudimentary pelvic bones of the whales‚ the worm·
like appendage attached to the caecum ol the large intestine in man
and many mammals '' p. resonat-De evolutione equi scribit: “ The
beautiful form and struiture oi this animal were not made at once, but
by a slow process of integration oi small changes from generation to '
generation, and from epoch to epoch of the earth’s history... This
was a small animal, no bigger than a lox, with three toes behind and
four serviceable toes in front, with an additional fifth palmbone
(splint)‚ and perhaps a rudimentary finh toe like a dew-claw. This was
in early Eocene times. Then, in later Eocene, came the orobe'ppus,
which differs from the last chiefly in the disappearance of the rudimen· ¹
i tary fifth toe and splint. Next, in the Miocene, came the mesolzippus
and rrer'olrippus. These were larger animals (about the size of a sheep), '
, and had three serviceable toes all around... Then,in the ¹llliocene, came
the prolohrytpres and plr'olrz'ppus. These were still larger animals being
about the size of an ass Lastly, only in the Quaternay, comes the‘
Ι genus Equus, or true horse. The sizeol theatilmallsbecome greater. g
