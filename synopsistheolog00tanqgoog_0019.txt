l take a special pleasure' in congratulating you on the
favorable impression which your “Synopsis leeolog' στα) Dog-
nzatz'cce specialis'' has already produced ui discerning theo-
logical criticS‚ including ‹rprofessors and students of our
ecclesiastica] Institutions ‘ ⁴ ’

“ What specially commends your work to my judgmenh
— apart from its perspicuous style and clearness of ex-
pression,— is your discussiones the great tscientific and
social questions of the day in the light of theology.

The student will thus be enabled not only to ascer-
tain the nature of the great problems which-agitate the
modern world‚'' but will find in the pages of your-book,
satisfaetory solutions of thern, as far as they are susceptible
of being solved bythe researches which have hitherto been
made in these departments os' human knowledge.

Ι The call for a new edition is a grateful evidence of
the warm manner in whichthe first edition has been

³ received.

’ I am yours faithfully in CHRIST‚
