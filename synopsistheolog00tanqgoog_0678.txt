Unitarians therefore generally hold Jes'usto'be'amam human in soul
and body . As the Scriptores frequently call J'esus the s'on- ol God,
but never call him God the son, Unitarians believehim lo have been

Him.. Tboug h they do not believe' rt right to call Jesus God, they
see no objection to the epithet divine: he was a divine man, not a

< N. 67. Christum non flasse deficatum caeco discipulorum-eurtu-
siasmo sic probath'drlon (The divinity os our Lord pem-274⁴) : “The
theory that Jesus was deified by enthusiasm assumes the existence of
Ξ a general disposition in mankind which is unwarranted byexperience.

ῗ much less in the superhuman origin ordignity'ol their fellowmen.
And to do them justice, thewriters who maintain thatJesus was invested
with divine honours by popular fervour, illustrate the weakness of their
own principle very conspicuously While they assert that nothing owas
more easy and obvious for the disciple of the apostolic ag e than to
believe m the divinity os his Master, they themselves reject that truth
with the greatest possible obstinacy and determination, well attested
though it be, now as then, by historical miracles and by overwhelmm
moral considerations'& ’
