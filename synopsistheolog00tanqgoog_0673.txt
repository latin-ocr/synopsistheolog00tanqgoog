Argumentum ex anatomici morplmlogi'cri sic comparatione-'illustra-
tur: “Natural classihcation may be better lilrened to a tree. The Ι
main trunk would represent the lowest organism. This soon separates,
into two main branches‚ the vegetable and the animal kingdoms.
Each of these gives off large branches, which are classes, and these
give off smaller, which ramily again into orders, genera, and finally
into spectas, which may be considered the leaves ol the tree. Now this
tree of lile is just what would have arisen, had all species come into
existence by evolution. Os course, God could, in his infinite wisdom
have formed such a plan and carried it out by means os direci creu-
tion. But we should never have recourse to a pretematural explana·
tion ol the phenomena ol nature, when we can lind a sufficient
explanation ol them in nature itsell''. (A. Orban, Amer. Cath. Quar-

terly Rev. April 1891, p. 288). ι

Quaedam exempla fecunditatis hybridamm exhibet Claus-Sedgwick l

Text-bookol Zoology, p. ml: “There are, however, exceptions to i
the sterility of the hybrid which appear to afford weighty proos against , ἶ
immutability ol species The experiments in breeding between the Ι
hare and rabbit, made on a large scale in Angouleme by Rana, have
shown that their progeny, the hare-rabbit, is perfecily fertile. Halt-
bred hybrids of the rabbit and hare have been bred, and have been t
reproduciive through many generations of pure in-breeding. In like
manner careful inquiries into the hybridism of plants‚ especially the
investigations of ll'. Heriem, lead to the conclusion that many

hybrids are as perfetlly produclive among themselves as genuine l
species'’. i
