- latter is a mere automaton, a machine afling without consciousrie'ss,
without aim, blindly obeying. extemal sensorial impression. The ·
somnambulist, on the contrary, is'a subjefl, a personality‚ who afts
spontaneously, by his own impulse, or obeying the will of the operator,

c. XI, p. 78, anglice redditum The Human specieS, Appieton, 1890,
c. ΧΙ, p. 107 sq. ἑ “Now man and apes present a very striking con-
trast in respedl to type. Their organs‚ as I have already remarked,
correspond almost exattly term for term; but these organs are arranged
after a very different plan. ln man they are so arranged that he is
essentially a walder, while in apes they necessitate his being a climber
just as strongly... A walking animal cannot be descended from a
climbr'r'zg one... The researches of Welker upon the sphenoidal angle
of Virchow lead to the same conclusion, sor in man the angle dimin-
ishes from the time of birth, whilst in the ape it is always increasing,
so much so that sometimes it is effaced ln the ape the temporal
sphenoidal convolutions, which form the middle lobe, make their
appearance and are completed before the anterior convolutions which
form the frontal lobe. ln man, on the contrary, the frontal convolutions
are the first to appear, and those of the middle lobe are formed later.
lt is evident, especially after the most fundamental principles of
Darwinism‚ that an organized being cannot be a descendant of another
whose development is in an inverse order to its own. Consequently...
man cannot he considered as the descendant of any simian type
whatever ''.

Intellec‘luales caulem honzz'nisfocullales a brutorum instinflu non de-
rivari sic asserit A. Wallace‚ licet Darwinismum aliunde advocet:
“ The special faculties we have been discussing clearly point to the
existence in man of something which he has not derived from his
animal progenitore something which we may best refer to as being of
a spiritual essence or nature, capable of progressive development
under favorable conditione. On the hypothesis of this spiritual nature,
superadded to the animal nature of man, we are able to understand
much that is otherwise mysterious or unintelligible in regard to him,
especially the enormous influence of ideas principles, and beliefs,
over his whole life and actions Thus we may perceive that the
love of truth, the delight in beauty, the passion for justice, and the
thrill of exultation with which we hea'r of any acl of courageous self·

j sacrifice, are the workings within us of a higher nature which has

f

not been developed by means of the struggle for material existence ''
(straminum, ch. 15).
