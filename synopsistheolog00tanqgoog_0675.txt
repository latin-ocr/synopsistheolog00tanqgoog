N. 122. illivart ostendere nititur suum systema Scriptura non od·
versari: ‘⁸ Scripture seems plainly to indicate this when it says that
God made man from the dust of the earth, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life ''. This is a plain and direft statement that
man's body was not created in the primary and absolute sense of the
word, but was evolved from pre-existing material... and was, therefore,
derivatively created, i. e.‚ by the operation of secondary laws. His
soul, on the other hand, was created in quite a different way not by
any preexisting means external to God, but by the dirett adtion of the
Almighty, symbolized by the term “ breathing '' (Minori, Genesis of
species, c. 12, 300).

A nnulos intermedias inter hottiinem et brutum aribus desiderari fa·
tentur hodierni transformistae : “ ln vain were we hunting for these
missing links which ought to connati man direftly with the monkey3
the primitive man, the proanthropos has not yet been found... At the
present moment we can say that among the peoples of ancient times
none was any nearer to the ape than we are. Every existing race is
human; even though some show charafteristics or forms peculias to t
the ape. We cannot assert positively and truthfully that on this
account these men look like monkeys''. lta ½·rct0w·(Congress of
Anthropology, Vienna, 18893 cf. Tlrein, Christian Anthropology,
n. 128).

N. 1²9· Discrimina, quainter varim horriinum stirpes vigent, dis·
paritatem originis rum arguere satietur Darwin (Descent of Mamp. Ι,
c. 7): “Although the existing races of man differ in many respefis,
as in colour, hair, shape of skuli, proportions of the body, etc, yet if -1
their whole organization be taken into consideration, they are found
to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points. Many of l
these points are of so unimportant, or of so singular a nature, that it t
is extremely improbable that they should have been independently
acquired by aboriginally distintl species or races. The same remark =
holds good with equal or greater force with respett to the numerous
points of mental similarity between the most distin& races of men...''

N. 130. Ea linguarum varietate nil deducitur contra unitatem ge·
neris humani: “Though languages may at first sight appear very
different, though their notions, humors, peculiarities may seem very
singular, nevertheless they betray a certain analogy‚ and we shall
understand their numerous relations better according as the philoso
phical history of nations and the study of language become more
perfett³’. Ita Humbaldt' apud Τ lict'o, op, cit. n. 277. ldem docent
