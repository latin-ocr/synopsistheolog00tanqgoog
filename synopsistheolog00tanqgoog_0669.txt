hl. rsa-155. Deprredoslinatorum numero haec habet Faber,(Creator,
B. ΙΙΙ, c. 2): “lf the pa'rables of the Gospel might be taken as
proofs, we should rather conclude that the greater, not the less num·
ber would be saved. J. C. compares the separation of the good and
bad at the last judgment, to the division of the good grain fro'rn the
cockle. Now, in a field cultivated with care, the cockle is never more
abundant than the wheat. He compares it to the separation of the

revealed truth than that of others, this is owing merely to his reserve
in speakingon the subjedt. His obscurity allows room for an ingenious
fancy to impose a meaning upon him Whether he includes in his
T rinity the notion of a first Cause, its aflive energy,and the influence
resulting from it; or again the divine substance as the source ‘of all
spiritual beings from eternity, the divine power and wisdom as exerted
in time in the formation of the material world, and thirdly, the innum-
erable derivative spirits by whom the world is immediately governed,
is altogether doubtful ²³. - “ Nay, even the writers who revived his
philosophy in the third and fourth centuries after Christ, and embellish-
ed the doftrine with additions from Scripture, discover a like extra·
ordinary variation in their mode of expounding it. The Maker of

the world, the Demiurge, considered hy Plato sometimes as the (nst,
