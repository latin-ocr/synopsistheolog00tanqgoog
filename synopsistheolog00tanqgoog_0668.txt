His own infinity. He was from etemity ever in adlion, though ever

’ at rest; ever surely in rest and peace proluund and ineffable‚ yet with
a living present mind, sels-possessed, and all conscious, comprehend-
ing Himsels and sustaining the comprehension. He rested ever, but
He rested in Himself3 His own resource, Hisown end, His own
contemplation, His own blessedness '’. ¹

N· 44 [rasinitam Ilei perlationem accurate describit J. H. New-
mem .· “ God is an lndividual‚ Seli-dependent, All-perset‘t, Unchange- '
able Being; intelligent, living, personal and present; almighty,
all-seeing, all-remembering3 between whom and His creatures there
is an infinite gulf; who has no origin, who is all-sufficient lor Himself;
who created and upholds the universe ; who will judge every one of
us, sooner or later, according to that Law ol right and wrong which He
has written on our hearts. He is one who is sovereign over, operative
amidst, independent ot', the appointments which He has made: One

in whose hands are all things, who has a purpose in every event, and
a standard lor every deed, and thus has relations of His own towards

the subjedtmatter of each particular science which the book ol know-
ledge unfolds3 who has with an adorable, never-ceasing energy im·
plicaled Himself in all the history ol creation‚ the constitution of ⁸
nature, the course ol the world, the origin of society, the fortunes ol
uatium, the adtion of the human mind ”. (Idea of u Um'versity,

ms. 11, p. 36 eu. 1888).

hl. 126. Antelapsartbrmrr systema sic exponit C. Hodge, calvinista :
“According to this view, God, in order to manifest his grace and
justice, selected from creatahle men (ἰ. e. from men to be created) a
certain number to be vessels ol mercy, and certain others to be vessels
ol wrath. lu the order of thought, eledlion and reprobation precede
the purpose to create and to permit the tall. Creation is in order to
redemption. God creates some to be saved, and others to be lost '’.
lpse autem haec repudiat. (S yslemolic theol„ New York, 1885, t. ll,
p. 316).

Infralapsarthrum systema sic describit (p. 319): “According to
the inlralapsarian doctrine, God, with the design to reveal his own
glory rletermined to create the world, secondly, to permit the lall
ol man 3 thirdly, to eledt from the mass ol fallen men a multitude
whom no man could number, as “vessels ol mercy'’; fourthly, to
send his Son lor their redempti0n; and filthly, to leave the residue οῖ’
mankind, as he left the dullen angels, to suffer the just punishment of
their sins ''.

N· 137. catholicam expositionem capitu IX ad Rom. optimi Prote-
stantium exegetae hodie admittunt : “The absolute election ol Jacob,
, --the lovt'rrg of Jacob and the lrutz'ng’ol Esau—has reference simply
to the elediion of one to higher privileges as head of the chosen race,

³ than the other. lt has nothing to do with their eternal salvadeu. trs
