Ν. 115 Convenieutz'ae argumentum ad suadendum SS. Tmuz'tatth
mysterium eloquenter exponit Lacordaire (Confer. de N. Dame,
48e Confi, De la Vie intime de Dieu; angl. vers. Cous. on God, The
Inner Life of God), ubi haec inter alia dicit ε “ God isa spirit 3 His
first aa, then, is to think. But His thought could not be like ours,
multiple, unceasingly appearing but to vanish, and vanishing but to
appear again. Ours is multiple, because, since we are finite, vwe can
but represent to ourselves one by one the objetls susceptible of being '
known to us... On the contrary, in God, whose activity is infinite, the

mind at once engenders a thought equal to itsell, which fully represents
it, and which needs no second expression, because the first has
exhausted the abyss of things to know, the abyss os the infinite. That
unique and absolute thought, the first-born and the last ol the
mind ol God, remains eterna-lly in His presence as an exa& represen-
tation of Himself, or to speak the language of the sacred books as
. “His image,the brightnessof his glory, and the figureof his substance'’...
l, In man the thought is distinet from the mind by an imperfettdistinc-
Ι tion, because it is finite; in God the thought is distinet from the mind
ἰ by a perfeel distinction, because it is infinite : that is to say, that iu
l man the thought does not attain to becorning a person, whilst in God
' it does attain thereto... When we have thought, a second ao
appears : we love... Love isat the same time distinct from themind,
ἱ and distinct from the thought... and yet it proceeds from theone and
J from the other, and forms but one with both... In God it is the same.
From the coeterna} regard interchanged between the Father and the
' Son, springs a third term os relation, proceeding from the one and the
other, really distinct from thern, raised by the force os the infinite to
personality, and which is the Holy Ghost, that is to say, the holy, the
unfnthomable and stainless movement os divine love. As the Son
exhausts knowledge, the Holy Ghost exhausts lovein God, and by Him

, the cycle of divine fecundity and lise closes''.

concedit Dillman (Genesis, p. 9), qui, licet rationalisticis faveat ideis,

· de mosaica cosmogonizt scribit : “From the moment an attempt was
made to portray, iu language intelligibile to man, the work of creation,
something that will ever remain a mystery to us, it has been impossi-
ble to outline a pitture which is grander or more worthy. With
