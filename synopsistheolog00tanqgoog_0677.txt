Primcevum hominem tirtellrgentice gradu haud inferiori luisse prce·
dr'lum candide fatetur Vircfrow (Congress of Anthropol. Munich‚
Sept. 1877) : “When we study the quatemary fossil man, who
certainly should resemble our original ancestors more than we do
we always find a man like ourselves lt is a little over ten years ago
that skulls were found on the turf, in the lacustrine deposits‚ or in the
ancient caves. Scientists thought they saw in them singular charafters
pointing towards a savage state, incompletely developed But all
such notions are vanishing. The ancient troglodytes, the cave-duell> ·
ers, the men of the turf prove to be quite a respectable society. They
have heads of such proportions that many individuals now living would
think themselves happy if they had heads as large And when we
compare the whole of the fossil remains known until now with the pre·
sent state of things we may boldly say that among the men now living
there exists a much greater number of individuals relatively inferior
than among the fossils in question '’.

N. 207. Originalis peccati transmissio illustratur lege almaniam,
quam ipsi rationalistae agnoscunt: “Modern French philosophers
have dwelt much on what they call the solidarity of the human race.
By this they mean that two individuals are not independent of each
other like two trees standing side by side, but like two buds on the
same tree or bough. There is a common life-sap flowing through them
all. Let the life of the tree be attacked anywhere, in its roots, its
trunk‚ its limbs‚ and all these individual buds feel it so it is with
separate men grafted into the great 'tree of mankind. No one lives to
himself, nor dies to himself. If one suffers, all suffer. The life of

mankind becoming diseased pours disease into all individual men ”
(l. F. Clarae, Orthod. p. 136).

N. 29. Socz'nr'cwzorrmz docirr'na apud Sclurff, Christ and Christianity.
p. 95-96, sic exponitur: “By nature Christ is only a man and his
existence began with his conception and birth. Nevertheless he is
distinct from all other men by several peculiaritieS, and has become .
by grace and by his own merits the son of God in a preeminent sense.
Socinianism admits his supernatural conception by an immediate act
of divine omnipotence without the agency of man; his sinless life
and charafter3 his miracles; his resurrection and ascension. lt
asserts the peculiar doftrine that JesuS‚ before he entered upon his
public ministry, was once or twice miraculously carried up to heaven
(like Paul) and direffly instrudted by the Father concerning the way
of salvation ³³.
