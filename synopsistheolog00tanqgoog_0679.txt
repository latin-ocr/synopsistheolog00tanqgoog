Deum: theassumption of humaniry into God. lt is not the conversion
of Godhead into flesh, nor the conversion ol the flesh into Godhead.
lt is not the εοηίιιιίοῐι oi two natures into one. lt is the assumption
of human nature into the unity οἰ the divine Person of the Etennal
son ot God. He took the nature oi man3 He assumed it to Himseli...
There were in Jesus two distinct and perfeci natones, neither changed
nor conlounded. lt is impossiblethat the divine nature should become
the human, or that the human should become the divine ε for eternity
3ηά infinity cannot be communicated to the creature3 neither can
etemity or infinity be put off or circumscribed to the outline anrl
stature of the creature. The two natures were perfetily distinct, with·
out diminution or confusion But though He had two natureS, two
intelligences‚ two lrearts and two wills perse& 3ηά distinet, yet there
was but one agent. All His actions were divine and human, because
mergent is both God and man. His actions are therefore called
theandric or deividos, because they arethe actions of God and man.
There is but one agent, because there is but one person; and that one ²
person is the person of the Eternal Word The absence of human ’-
personality in the lucarnation oi theson is no imperfectiori os the ;
sacred Humanity. lt is its highest perfeetion. Our human nature
was elevated3 it was persetled with a perfetlion above its own. and
was thereby litted above the order of creation. lt was assumed into
immediate union with a divine Person, 3ηά because it was assumed
into the unity of a divine Person it was in Him united to the Divino
Nature, and thereby deified ''.

N. 116. Displicent formam henotico theoriae sic exponit H. C. Powell ³
(The Principle ol the lucarnation‚ 1896, p. 232-33): “He (Godet) 1
maintained that Our Lord, during His life on earth, actually laid aside Ῑ
His divine omnipotence, omniscience‚ omnipresence‚ holiness‚ love, 3
consciousness‚exchangr'ng these Divine attributes for human ones, and j
especially allowing His divine consciousness of Sonship to he ²
e.rtinguislzed within Him. According to Godet‚ then, our Lord, though i
He was God the son, was on earth as God without Godhead Bu g
when we turn to the views ol English writers on the subjeci, we bynu ²
means find them equally decided in expression. No one seems to -
have adopted Godet’s view in all its naked boldness of statement. J
Mr Gore certainly has not done so. He does indeed speak oi our l
Lord as having in some sense “abandoned’' His divine attributes. l
He minimises as much as possible the exercise of Divine power in his ÷
miracles. He describes His “ illumination ’⁵ as being analogous to that
of Apostles and ProphetS, though of much higher degree. But lte also
speaks of our Lord as “not habitually living in the exercise of
omniscience'’, from which expression it seems fair to conclude that, in t
‘face of the evrdence of the Gospels, he did not see his way to the
position that our Lord abandoned llis divine attributes or His omni·
