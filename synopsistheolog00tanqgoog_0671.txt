N· 34. Narrationem mosaicam esse dr'vino hionnam,- i. e. divim'lus
lietuiniimpirarum bene exponit Dana, in naturalibus scientiis optime
versatus : “ Again, ff divine, tlte account must bear marks of hanun
irnperfeffrhn, since it war commrmicaled through man. ldeas suggested
to a human mind by the Deity, would take shape in that mind accord·
ing to its range of knowledge, modes of thought, and use of language...
The central thought of each step in the Scripture cosmogony-for
example, Light; the Dividing of the fluid earth from the fiuid around
it, individualizing the earth; the Arrangement of its land and water;

‘ Vegetation; and so on-is brought out in the simple and natural style
of a sublime intellefl‚ wise for its times, but unversed in the depths of
science which the future was to reveal The order of events in the
Scripture cosmogony corresponds essentially with that which hasbeen
given (in the Manual of Geology)... ln this succession we observe not
merely an order of events, like that deduced from science3 there isa Ι
system in the arrangement and a far-reaching prophecy, to which !
philosophy could not have attained however instrufled'’. (Manual of
Geology, New York, 1880, p. 847, 849).

N. 38. Generattonem spontaneam, eo sensu acceptam quod Deus
ipse materiae dederit facultatem, in certis circumstantiis, viventia pro
ducendi, non esse fidei contrariam, optime declarat‘Gladstone(1nrr0-
duction to the People'r Br'ble History) .· “ Suppose for a moment that
it were found or could be granted in the augmentation of science that
the first and lowest forms of life have been evolved from lifeless
matter as their immediate antecedent. What statement of H. Scripture
would be shaken by the discovery? What would it prove to uS, except
that there had been given to certain inanimato substances the power,
when they were brought into certain combinations, of reappearing in
some of the low forms which lire, but live without any of the worthier
prerogatives of lif ἓ Νο conclusion would follow for reasonable men, ¹
except the perfeflly rational conclusion that the Almighty had seen fit
to endow with certain powers in particular circumstances and to with·
hold from them in other circumstances, the material elements which
He had created, and of which it was surely for Him to determine the
conditions of existence and productive power, and the sphere and
manner of their operation ”.

N. 39. De facio autem ίρειιενιιίῐο spontanea minime probatur; nam
Harlev ipse ait (Origin of species, leci. lll): Mr Pasteur arrived at
last at the clear and definite result, that all these appearances are lilre
