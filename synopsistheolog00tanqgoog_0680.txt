EXCERPTA Ex ANGLICIS AUCTORIBUS. 15*

N. 173. S. Anselmi dorfrlnam de necessitate Incarnatiom's ita con-
trahit oxentam (The Catholic dodrine of the Atonement, 1881,
p. 183-185) : “ lt is impossible that mankind, as a whole, should fail
to attain the end for which they were created, because it is inconsistent
with the being of God to suffer any rational nature to perish completely
and thus to fail to perfedi the work He has begun But man has
forsaken his true end by sin, and can only be restored to it by redemp-
tion. By sin he has robbed God of what was due to Him from human
nature, aud has, so far as was possible deprived Him of a part of His

, honor (Deum exhonorat); lte has committed an evil which, if not '
atlually infinite, is yet so great that the preservation of the universe
would be too dearly purchased by the commissionol even the slightest
sin. And therefore he has incurred a debt which can only be paidby
something greater than the whole universe, greater than all that is ·
outside God. But he has nothing to pay it with himself, for all that
he has and is he already owes to God as his Creator, without any
reference to the compensation of sin... Nor indeed, is free forgiveness
possible· God cannot suffer anything to mar the perfect order ol his
kingdom. ’ The sinner must either make adequate satisfadlion to God,

according to the measure of his sin, or endure the penalty. This
satisfactiou, to be equal to the sin, must be greater than anything
outside God, and therefore only God can supply it; but it must be
paid by man, or it is not man's satisfadlion. The debt was so great
. that *none but God could pay it, and none but man owes it, therefore
; One must pay it who is God and Man. Hence the necessity for
tlte incarnation. But the lncarnation would not suffice of itself. The
j perfedt obedience of Christ, as Man, could beno satisfaction for sin,
for obedience is due to God from every rational creature. But His
death was not due, for death is an obligation incurred by sin; aud His
death accordingly, asa voluntary offering, is the sufficient and only
possible satisfadiion, which not only equals, but infinitely exceed5‚ the
pryment owed for the sins of the whole world ²¹. ⁸
N. 180. Urciturc'r' suum de saltrsaflione Cltrtrfr' systema sic expo·
nunt : “The innocent cannot be ptrrtz'slred'in the place of the guilty;
buthe can suffer, and constantly does suffer, in the place of the
guilty Christ did not die to pay a debt to God, or to appease his
wrath, but to “bring us to 'Godt and to put the Spirit into our heart ⁸
by which we can say “Abba Father''. The atonement is made to
the divine justice —but not to distributive justice, which rewards and
punisheS, but to divine justice in its highest form, as holiness. ,Αηά
this consists in making us fit to appear before God, notwithstanding·
ι ur sinfulness, because we have received a principle of holiness
vlrich will ultimately cast out all our sins’' (F. Clurke, Orthodoxy‚
i hap.X,249‚2t>4).
