Ν. 13r. Nil pariter cieduci potest ex difficullale remotas insulas
attingendi. De incolis Oceaniae haec habet Waitz, Germanus ratio·

nalista: “These difficulties are evidently nowhere greater than in
the Pacific Ocean οι· even as great3 and yet the Pacific Ocean affords

abundant proofs not only that these difficulties are not insuperable‚ but
also that they do not hinder either immigration from other countries
or the spreading ol the inhabitants from one group of islands to
another ’² (Anthropologie‚ vol. l, p. 2²5) Quoad Amerr'cam, haec no·
tare sufficiat : “From 1872 to 1876 sorry-nine Chinese barks' were
carried along by the currents towards the Pacific Ocean3 rlineteen
landed on the Aleutian lslands‚ ten on the shores oi Alaska, three on
those of the United States‚ two on the Sandwich lslands ''. (T heiu,
op. cit. n. 289).

N. 162. S lautus barbarior, in quibusdam regionibus adhucprcevolenr‚
non probat hominem ab initio fm'sse barbonem .· quod optime evolvit
Argyll (Primeval man, p. lV) : “Yet nothing in the natural history
of Man can be more certain than both morally and intelledlually, and
physically he can, and he osten does sink from a higher to a lower
level. This is true of Man both colleclively and individually, of men
and of societies of men. Some regions of the world are strewn with
the monuments of civilizations which have passed away. Rude and
barbarous tribes stare with wonder on the remains of TempleS, of
which they cannot conceive the purpose, and of cities which arethe
dens of heasts... Now what are the changes of external circumstance
which first, in the natural course of things, would bring an adverse
influence to bear upon Mankind? This cause is simply the law of
increase... Hence the necessity of migrations... Then‚ as it would
always be the weaker tribes who would be driven from the ground
which had become overstocked, and as the lands to which they went
forth were less and less hospitable in climate and productions, the
struggle ior life would be always harder. And so it always happens in
the natural and necessary course of things that the races which were
driven farthest would be the rudest, the most engrossed in the pursuits
of mere animal existence ⁷². ss Quod praesertim de religione affirmari
potest : ‘⁴ If there is one thing which acomparative study of religions
places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every reli·

l gion is exposed... Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first
beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its

¹ later stages ”. (Max Moror,ChipsfromaGermanWorkshop,vol.r
v praefi XXIII). ’
